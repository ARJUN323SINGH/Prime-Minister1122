            <h1>Politics of INDIA</h1>
        </center>
    </u>
    <b>
        <p>Politics of India works within the framework of the country's Constitution. India is a parliamentary secular
            democratic republic in which the president of India is the head of state & first citizen of India and the
            Prime
            Minister of India is the head of government</p>
    </b>
    <p>There are 543 members in the Lok Sabha, who are elected using plurality voting (first past the post) system from
        543 Single-member district. There are 245 members in the Rajya Sabha, out of which 233 are elected through
        indirect elections by single transferable vote by the members of the state legislative assemblies; 12 other
        members are elected/nominated by the President of India. Governments are formed through elections held every
        five years (unless otherwise specified), by parties that secure a majority of members in their respective lower
        houses (Lok Sabha in the central government and Vidhan Sabha in states). India had its first general election in
        1951, which was won by the Indian National Congress, a political party that went on to dominate subsequent
        elections until 1977, when a non-Congress government was formed for the first time in independent India. The
        1990s saw the end of single-party domination and the rise of coalition governments. The latest 18th Lok Sabha
        elections was conducted in seven phases from 19 April 2024 to 1 June 2024 by the Election commission of India.
        The results bought in the NDA (National Democratic Alliance) to form in the next government [5]

        In recent decades, Indian politics has become a dynastic affair.[6] Possible reasons for this could be the party
        stability, absence of party organisations, independent civil society associations that mobilise support for the
        parties and centralised financing of elections.[7] According to the V-Dem Democracy indices India in 2023 was
        the 19th most electoral democratic country in Asia</p>

    <h2>About Prime Minister</h2>
    <p>The prime minister of India is the head of government of the Republic of
        India. Executive authority is vested in the prime minister and his chosen Council of Ministers,[4][5][6]
        despite the president of India being the nominal head of the executive.The prime minister has to
        be a member of one of the houses of bicameral Parliament of India, alongside heading the respective house.[11]
        The prime minister and his cabinet are at all times responsible to the Lok Sabha.

        The prime minister is appointed by the president of India; however, the prime minister has to enjoy the
        confidence of the majority of Lok Sabha members, who are directly elected every five years, lest the prime
        minister shall resign. The prime minister can be a member of the Lok Sabha or of the Rajya Sabha, the upper
        house of the parliament. The prime minister controls the selection and dismissal of members of the Union Council
        of Ministers; and allocation of posts to members within the government.

        The longest-serving prime minister was Jawaharlal Nehru, also the first prime minister, whose tenure lasted 16
        years and 286 days. His premiership was followed by Lal Bahadur Shastri's short tenure and Indira Gandhi's 11-
        and 4-year-long tenures, both politicians belonging to the Indian National Congress. After Indira Gandhi's
        assassination, her son Rajiv Gandhi took charge until 1989, when a decade with five unstable governments began.
        This was followed by the full terms of P. V. Narasimha Rao, Atal Bihari Vajpayee, Manmohan Singh, and Narendra
        Modi. Modi is the 14th and current prime minister of India, serving since 26 May 2014.</p>

        <h2>Narendra Damodardas Modi</h2>
        <u>
            <h4>Present Prime MinisterOf India</h4>
        </u>
        <p>Narendra Damodardas Modi was born 17 September 1950)[a] is an Indian
            politician who is the 14th and current <b> Prime Minister of India</b> since 26 May 2014. Modi was the chief
            minister of Gujarat from 2001 to 2014 and is the Member of Parliament (MP) for Varanasi. He is a member of
            the Bharatiya Janata Party (BJP) and of the Rashtriya Swayamsevak Sangh (RSS), a right wing Hindu
            nationalist paramilitary volunteer organisation. He is the longest-serving prime minister outside the Indian
            National Congress.</p>
        <p>Modi was born and raised in Vadnagar in northeastern Gujarat, where he completed his secondary education. He
            was introduced to the RSS at the age of eight. At the age of 18, he was married to Jashodaben Modi, whom he
            abandoned soon after, only publicly acknowledging her four decades later when legally required to do so.
            Modi became a full-time worker for the RSS in Gujarat in 1971. The RSS assigned him to the BJP in 1985 and
            he rose through the party hierarchy, becoming general secretary in 1998.[b] In 2001, Modi was appointed
            Chief Minister of Gujarat and elected to the legislative assembly soon after. His administration is
            considered complicit in the 2002 Gujarat riots,[c] and has been criticised for its management of the crisis.
            According to official records, a little over 1,000 people were killed, three-quarters of whom were Muslim;
            independent sources estimated 2,000 deaths, mostly Muslim.[12] A Special Investigation Team appointed by the
            Supreme Court of India in 2012 found no evidence to initiate prosecution proceedings against him.[d] While
            his policies as chief minister were credited for encouraging economic growth, his administration was
            criticised for failing to significantly improve health, poverty and education indices in the state.</p>
            <p>

            In the 2014 Indian general election, Modi led the BJP to a parliamentary majority, the first for a party
            since 1984. His administration increased direct foreign investment, and it reduced spending on healthcare,
            education, and social-welfare programmes. Modi began a high-profile sanitation campaign, controversially
            initiated a demonetisation of banknotes and introduced the Goods and Services Tax, and weakened or abolished
            environmental and labour laws. Modi's administration launched the 2019 Balakot airstrike against an alleged
            terrorist training camp in Pakistan. The airstrike failed,[15][16] but the action had nationalist
            appeal.[17] Modi's party won the 2019 general election which followed.[18] In its second term, his
            administration revoked the special status of Jammu and Kashmir,[19][20] and introduced the Citizenship
            Amendment Act, prompting widespread protests, and spurring the 2020 Delhi riots in which Muslims were
            brutalised and killed by Hindu mobs.[21][22][23] Three controversial farm laws led to sit-ins by farmers
            across the country, eventually causing their formal repeal. Modi oversaw India's response to the COVID-19
            pandemic, during which, according to the World Health Organization's estimates, 4.7 million Indians
            died.[24][25] In the 2024 general election, Modi's party lost its majority in the lower house of Parliament
            and formed a government leading the National Democratic Alliance coalition.[26][27]
        </p>
        <p>
            Under Modi's tenure, India has experienced democratic backsliding, or the weakening of democratic
            institutions, individual rights, and freedom of expression.[28][29][f] As prime minister, he has received
            consistently high approval ratings.[35][36][37] Modi has been described as engineering a political
            realignment towards right-wing politics. He remains a controversial figure domestically and internationally,
            over his Hindu nationalist beliefs and handling of the Gujarat riots, which have been cited as evidence of a
            majoritarian and exclusionary social agenda.</p>

          <p>  Early life and education
            Narendra Damodardas Modi was born on 17 September 1950 to a Gujarati Hindu family of oil presser
            (Modh-Ghanchi) which is an Other Backward Class (OBC) category[44][45] in Vadnagar, Mehsana district, Bombay
            State (present-day Gujarat). He was the third of six children born to <b>
             Damodardas Mulchand Modi
            (c. 1915–1989) and Hiraben Modi (1923–2022)</b></p>
